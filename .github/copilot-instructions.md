## General

- This is a presentation project. I'm working on a presentation about AI adoption for teams and organizations.
- The presentation is for a conference, and I need to make sure it's engaging and informative.
- The audience is likely to be a mix of technical and non-technical people, so I need to balance the content accordingly.
- The presentation should be around 30-45 minutes long, with time for questions at the end.
- The presentation is about AI adoption for teams and organizations, so I need to make sure the content is relevant to that topic.
- I want to include real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the points I'm making.
- I want to make sure the presentation is visually appealing, with a good balance of text and images.
- I want to make sure the presentation is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
- I want to include a call to action at the end of the presentation, encouraging the audience to think about how they can apply what they've learned in their own organizations.

## Tech
