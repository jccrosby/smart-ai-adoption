# The Myths & Misconceptions of AI (10 min)

- What AI **is** and **isn’t** (brief overview of LLMs, generative AI, automation)
- Common myths:
  - “AI will do everything for you.”
  - “AI is a silver bullet that makes work faster and easier.”
  - “AI will replace software engineers.”
  - “If we don’t adopt AI now, we’ll fall behind.”
- Reality check: AI **augments**, not replaces—unless you don’t learn how to use it.
