# The Current Landscape

1. The software development world is experiencing rapid change due to AI advancements - especially in with LLMs and generative AI.
2. Many developers and organizations are experimenting with or using AI tools in their workflows.
3. Applications span the Software Development Life Cycle, from coding to deployment.
4. Teams may feel overwhelmed by the hype and the sheer volume of available tools.
5. The pressure to "do something with AI" can lead to rushed decisions and poor outcomes.
6. The challenge is to navigate this landscape wisely, avoiding the pitfalls of blind FOMO while harnessing the potential of AI.

# The Dual Edge: Opportunity vs. Hype

- **Opportunity:** AI offers benefits like enhanced productivity, improved code quality, faster development cycles, and potential for innovation.
- **Risk:** AI project failure rates remain high due to flawed adoption strategies.
- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Lack of clear goals, no coherent strategy, neglecting data readiness, and "Blind FOMO".
  - Pressure to "do something with AI" can exacerbate these issues.

# Smart Adoption vs. Blind FOMO: The Core Difference

- **Smart Adoption:** Deliberate, strategic approach focused on solving specific problems and achieving measurable improvements. Involves learning and assessment before significant investment.
- **Blind FOMO:** Reactive, technology-centric adoption driven by hype rather than a specific problem. Often skips crucial learning and assessment.
- **How AI is adopted is more critical than whether it is adopted.**

---
layout: default
---

# Six Core Principles

- **Strategic:** AI initiatives must solve specific problems aligned with business goals. Define _why_ before _what_.
- **Data Readiness & Governance:** Strong data quality, accessibility, security, and governance are essential. Poor data leads to failure.
- **Skills & Culture:** Requires technical skills and a supportive culture encouraging experimentation, sharing, and learning.
- **Technology & Infrastructure:** Select the right tools compatible with existing workflows.
- **Ethics & Responsibility:** Integrate ethical considerations (fairness, transparency, privacy, security) from the start.
- **Iterative Approach:** Start with small pilots, learn, and scale successful initiatives.

# Analogy - Blind FOMO

## Mandated Generative AI for Code

---
layout: default
---

# Blind FOMO - Skipped LEAP Steps

- **Skipped Learn:** Vague goal ("increase velocity"), ignored readiness (skills, codebase, IP), focused on tech (GenAI) over specific problems.
- **Skipped Experiment/Assess:** Underestimated verification needs, overlooked accuracy and security risks, ignored domain/context limitations.
- **Failed Propagate/Plan:** Resulted in chaos, inconsistent adoption, decreased productivity, potential security issues, no way to measure impact.
