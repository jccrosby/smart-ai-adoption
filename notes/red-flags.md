## **Red Flags to Watch For**

### **Real Problem vs. “Cool Factor”**

1. **Vague Use Cases:** No one can articulate a clear, tangible problem the AI will solve.
2. **Hype-Driven Adoption:** The primary motive is “everyone else is doing it,” rather than solving a real need.
3. **No Clear KPIs:** Teams lack measurable indicators for success (e.g., efficiency gains, error reduction).

### **Efficiency vs. Quality**

1. **Overemphasis on Speed Alone:** All focus is on faster processes, with little consideration for accuracy or effectiveness.
2. **Hidden Quality Costs:** Small lapses in quality go unnoticed during early testing and can escalate after deployment.

### **Risks (Bias, Security, Ethics)**

1. **Unverified Data Sources:** Training data origins are unclear, raising concerns about accuracy or bias.
2. **Weak Security Protocols:** No transparent plan for preventing data breaches or securing sensitive information.
3. **No Ethical Guidelines:** No framework to address potential algorithmic discrimination or misuse of the tool.

### **Trust in Outputs**

1. **Black-Box Models with No Explanation:** The AI’s decision-making process is opaque, making it hard to diagnose errors or biases.
2. **No Mechanism for Verification:** There’s no systematic way to check or replicate results for accuracy.
3. **Limited Testing:** The tool is rolled out broadly with minimal piloting or staged deployment.

### **Fit Into Existing Workflows**

1. **Major Workflow Disruption:** Implementation requires an overhaul of current systems, risking low user adoption and productivity dips.
1. **Inadequate User Training:** End users or frontline teams are not sufficiently prepared to integrate AI into their daily tasks.
1. **Lack of IT/Operations Readiness:** No clear plan for data management, software compatibility, or ongoing maintenance and support.
